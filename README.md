# lstr: partially lockable Python strings

`lstr` is a Python package for partially lockable strings.

## Installation

`lstr` requires Python 3.8 or later.

```bash
pip install lstr
```

## Example

### Creating an lstr

```python
from lstr import lstr

greeting = lstr("Hello, world!")
print(greeting)  # "Hello, world!"
```

### Writing text

One way to update an `lstr` is via `write()`. This will replace a specific range of characters with a new string.

For example, to change "Hello" to "Hey", write `Hey` at index `0` for length `5`:

```python
from lstr import lstr

greeting = lstr("Hello, world!")
greeting.write("Hey", index=0, length=5)
print(greeting)  # "Hey, world!"
```

### Getting help with indexes

To get help figuring out exactly which character is at exactly which index, call `repr()` for your `lstr`:

```python
from lstr import lstr

greeting = lstr("Hello, world!")
print(repr(greeting))
```

```text
  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
  H  e  l  l  o  ,     w  o  r  l  d  !
```

### Substituting text

The second method for updating an `lst` is via `sub()`. This will replace matches of a regular expression with a new string.

To replace one substring with another:

```python
from lstr import lstr

greeting = lstr("Hello!")
greeting.sub("l", "b")
print(greeting)  # "Hebbo!"
```

To replace each match of a regular expression with a group's value:

```python
from lstr import lstr

document = lstr("How *exciting!* So *bold!*")
document.sub(r"\*([^*]+)\*", r"<em>\g<1></em>")
print(document)  # "How <em>exciting!</em> So <em>bold!</em>"
```

### Locking

To prevent any changes to a region of the `lst`, lock it via `lock()`.

To prevent changes to the word "Hello" in "Hello, world!" create a lock from index `0` for length `5`:

```python
from lstr import lstr

greeting = lstr("Hello, world!")

print(repr(greeting))
#  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
#  H  e  l  l  o  ,     w  o  r  l  d  !

greeting.lock(index=0, length=5)
```

Now any changes to that region will be denied:

```python
from lstr import lstr

greeting = lstr("Hello, world!")
greeting.lock(index=0, length=5)

greeting.sub("Hello", "Hey")  # Amount.NONE
print(greeting)  # "Hello, world!"
```

Text outside of that region can still be updated

```python
from lstr import lstr

greeting = lstr("Hello, world!")
greeting.lock(index=0, length=5)

greeting.sub("Hello", "Hey")  # Amount.NONE
print(greeting)  # "Hello, world!"

greeting.sub("world", "there")  # Amount.ALL
print(greeting)  # "Hello, there!"
```

### Equality

`lstr` instances are considered equal only if their string value and locks are identical.

```python
lstr("f", locks=[Lock(index=1, length=2)]) == lstr("f", locks=[Lock(index=1, length=2)])
lstr("f", locks=[Lock(index=1, length=2)]) != lstr("f", locks=[Lock(index=3, length=4)])
```

`lstr` and `str` instances are considered equal if the string value is identical, regardless of the locks.

```python
lstr("f") == "f"
lstr("f") != "g"
```
